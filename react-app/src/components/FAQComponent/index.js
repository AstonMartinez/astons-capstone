                            <li>Good Habits (the ones with a colored plus sign) are tasks that you can do many times a day, such as eating vegetables. Bad Habits (the ones with a colored minus sign) are tasks that you should avoid, like biting nails. Habits with a colored plus sign and a colored minus sign have a good choice and a bad choice, like taking the stairs vs. taking the elevator. Good Habits award Experience and Gold. Bad Habits subtract Health.</li>
                            <li>Dailies are tasks that you have to do every day, like brushing your teeth or checking your email. You can adjust the days that a Daily is due by clicking the pencil item to edit it. If you skip a Daily that is due, your avatar will take damage overnight. Be careful not to add too many Dailies at once!</li>
                            <li>To Do's are your To Do list. Completing a To Do earns you Gold and Experience. You never lose Health from To Do's. You can add a due date to a To Do by clicking the pencil icon to edit.</li>
